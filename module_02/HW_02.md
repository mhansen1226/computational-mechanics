## Problems [Part 1](./01_Cheers_Stats_Beers.md)

1. Gordon Moore created an empirical prediction that the rate of
   semiconductors on a computer chip would double every two years. This
   prediction was known as Moore's law. Gordon Moore had originally only
   expected this empirical relation to hold from 1965 - 1975
   [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law),[2](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/gordon-moore-the-man-whose-name-means-progress)],
   but semiconductor manufacturers were able to keep up with Moore's law
   until 2015.

In the folder "../data" is a comma separated value (CSV) file,
"transistor_data.csv" [taken from wikipedia
01/2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count#Microprocessors).

a. Use the `!head ../data/transistor_data.csv` command to look at
the top of the csv. What are the headings for the columns?

b. Load the csv into a pandas dataframe. How many missing values
(`NaN`) are
in the column with the number of transistors? What fraction are
missing?

```{code-cell} ipython3
!head ../data/transistor_data.csv
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
transistor_data = pd.read_csv('../data/transistor_data.csv')
transistors = transistor_data['MOS transistor count']
transistors_clean = transistors.dropna()
missing = len(transistors) - len(transistors_clean)
print(f'Missing values: {missing}')
print(f'Percent missing: {missing/len(transistors)*100:.2f} %')
```

## Problems [Part 2](./02_Seeing_Stats.md)

1. Many beers do not report the IBU of the beer because it is very
   small. You may be accidentally removing whole categories of beer from
   our dataset by removing rows that do not include the IBU measure.

   a. Use the command `beers_filled = beers.fillna(0)` to clean the `beers` dataframe

   b. Repeat the steps above to recreate the plot "Beer ABV vs. IBU mean values by style"
   scatter plot with `beers_filled`. What differences do you notice between the plots?

```{code-cell} ipython3
beers = pd.read_csv('../data/beers.csv')
beers_filled = beers.fillna(0)
plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
ax = plt.axes(xlabel='ABV', ylabel='IBU', title='Scatter plot of alcohol-by-volume vs. IBU \n')
ax.scatter(x='abv', y='ibu', data=beers_filled);
```

This plot looks a little wider than the last one since it appears there were data points at the edges of the ABV spectrum that were lost due to dropping the `NaN` values

   In the folder "../data" is a comma separated value (CSV) file, "transistor_data.csv" [taken from wikipedia 01/2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count#Microprocessors).
   Load the csv into a pandas dataframe, it has the following headings:

   |Processor| MOS transistor count| Date of Introduction|Designer|MOSprocess|Area|
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|

   a. In the years 2017, what was the average MOS transistor count?
   Make a boxplot of the transistor count in 2017 and find the first, second and third quartiles.

   b. Create a semilog y-axis scatter plot (i.e. `plt.semilogy`) for the
   "Date of Introduction" vs "MOS transistor count".
   Color the data according to the "Designer".

```{code-cell} ipython3
filter_year = lambda y: transistor_data['Date of Introduction'] == y
transistors_2017 = transistor_data[filter_year(2017)]['MOS transistor count']
print(f'Average MOS transistor count: {transistors_2017.mean():,}')

```

ax.semilogy('Date of Introduction', 'MOS transistor count', 'o', data=transistor_data, alpha=0.5, linewidth=0);
```

## Problems [Part 3](03_Linear_Regression_with_Real_Data.md)

1. There is a csv file in '../data/primary-energy-consumption-by-region.csv' that has the energy consumption of different regions of the world from 1965 until 2018 [Our world in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/energy).
   Compare the energy consumption of the United States to all of Europe. Load the data into a pandas dataframe. *Note: you can get certain rows of the data frame by specifying what you're looking for e.g.
   `EUR = dataframe[dataframe['Entity']=='Europe']` will give us all the rows from Europe's energy consumption.*

   a. Plot the total energy consumption of the United States and Europe

   b. Use a linear least-squares regression to find a function for the energy consumption as a function of year

   energy consumed = $f(t) = At+B$

   c. At what year would you change split the data and use two lines like you did in the
   land temperature anomoly? Split the data and perform two linear fits.

   d. What is your prediction for US energy use in 2025? How about European energy use in 2025?

```{code-cell} ipython3
energy = pd.read_csv('../data/primary-energy-consumption-by-region.csv')
pivot_energy = energy.pivot(index='Year', columns='Entity', values='Primary Energy Consumption (terawatt-hours)')
eur_us = pivot_energy[['United States', 'Europe']]
eur_us.plot(figsize=(8,6), 
                title='Total Energy Consumption for Europe and US', 
                ylabel='Energy Consumption (TWhr)');
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
us = eur_us['United States']
eur = eur_us['Europe']

fig, (ax_us, ax_eur) = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharey=True, figsize=(10,6))
fig.suptitle('Total Energy Consumption for Europe and US')

xi_us, yi_us = us.index.values, us.values
lm = np.poly1d(np.polyfit(xi_us, yi_us, 1))
us.plot(ax=ax_us, title='United States', ylabel='Energy Consumption (TWhr)', label='', linewidth=0, marker='o')
ax_us.plot(xi_us, lm(xi_us), label=str(lm))
ax_us.legend();

xi_eur, yi_eur = eur.index.values, eur.values
lm = np.poly1d(np.polyfit(xi_eur, yi_eur, 1))
eur.plot(ax=ax_eur, title='Europe', label='', linewidth=0, marker='o')
ax_eur.plot(xi_eur, lm(xi_eur), label=str(lm))
ax_eur.legend();
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
split_year = {
    'us': 1981,
    'eur': 1991
}

fig, (ax_us, ax_eur) = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharey=True, figsize=(10,6))
fig.suptitle('Total Energy Consumption for Europe and US')

xi1, xi2 = xi_us[xi_us<=split_year['us']], xi_us[xi_us>=split_year['us']]
yi1, yi2 = us[xi1], us[xi2]
lm_us = np.poly1d(np.polyfit(xi1, yi1, 1)), np.poly1d(np.polyfit(xi2, yi2, 1))
us.plot(ax=ax_us, title='United States', ylabel='Energy Consumption (TWhr)', label='', linewidth=0, marker='o')
ax_us.plot(xi1, lm_us[0](xi1), label=str(lm_us[0]))
ax_us.plot(xi2, lm_us[1](xi2), label=str(lm_us[1]))
ax_us.legend();

xi1, xi2 = xi_eur[xi_eur<=split_year['eur']], xi_eur[xi_eur>=split_year['eur']]
yi1, yi2 = eur[xi1], eur[xi2]
lm_eur = np.poly1d(np.polyfit(xi1, yi1, 1)), np.poly1d(np.polyfit(xi2, yi2, 1))
eur.plot(ax=ax_eur, title='Europe', label='', linewidth=0, marker='o')
ax_eur.plot(xi1, lm_eur[0](xi1), label=str(lm_eur[0]))
ax_eur.plot(xi2, lm_eur[1](xi2), label=str(lm_eur[1]))
ax_eur.legend();

print(f'Predicted energy consumption for 2025 in the US: {lm_us[1](2025):.2f} TWhr')
print(f'Predicted energy consumption for 2025 in Europe: {lm_eur[1](2025):.2f} TWhr')
```

2. You plotted Gordon Moore's empirical prediction that the rate of semiconductors on a computer chip would double every two years in [02_Seeing_Stats](./02_Seeing_Stats). This prediction was known as Moore's law. Gordon Moore had originally only expected this empirical relation to hold from 1965 - 1975 [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law),[2](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/gordon-moore-the-man-whose-name-means-progress)], but semiconductor manufacuturers were able to keep up with Moore's law until 2015.

Use a linear regression to find our own historical Moore's Law.

Use your code from [02_Seeing_Stats](./02_Seeing_Stats) to plot the semilog y-axis scatter plot
(i.e. `plt.semilogy`) for the "Date of Introduction" vs "MOS transistor count".
Color the data according to the "Designer".

Create a linear regression for the data in the form of

$log(transistor~count)= f(date) = A\cdot date+B$

rearranging

$transistor~count= e^{f(date)} = e^B e^{A\cdot date}$

You can perform a least-squares linear regression using the following assignments

$x_i=$ `dataframe['Date of Introduction'].values`

and

$y_i=$ as `np.log(dataframe['MOS transistor count'].values)`

a. Plot your function on the semilog y-axis scatter plot

b. What are the values of constants $A$ and $B$ for our Moore's law fit? How does this compare to Gordon Moore's prediction that MOS transistor count doubles every two years?

```{code-cell} ipython3
data = pd.read_csv('../data/transistor_data.csv')
data = data.dropna()
xi=data['Date of Introduction'].values
TC=data['MOS transistor count'].values
log_TC = np.log(TC)
A, B = np.polyfit(xi, log_TC, 1)
lm = np.poly1d((A, B))
ax = plt.axes(xlabel='Date of Introduction', ylabel='MOS transistor count', title='Transistor Count vs. Introdution Date')
ax.semilogy('Date of Introduction', 'MOS transistor count', 'o', data=data, linewidth=0, alpha=.5)
ax.semilogy(xi, np.exp(lm(xi)), label=f'$e^{{{A:.2f}date{B:.2f}}}$')
ax.legend();
print(np.exp(A))
```

## Problems [Part 4](04_Stats_and_Montecarlo.md)

**1.** [Buffon's needle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon) is
another way to estimate the value of $\pi$ with random numbers. The goal
in this Monte Carlo estimate of $\pi$ is to create a ratio that is close
to [3.1415926...](http://www.math.com/tables/constants/pi.htm) *similar
to the example with darts points lying inside/outside a unit circle
inside a unit square.*

![Buffon's needle for parallel
lines](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Buffon_needle.gif)

In this Monte Carlo estimation, you only need to know two values:

- the distance from line 0, $x = [0,~1]$
- the orientation of the needle, $\theta = [0,~2\pi]$

The y-location does not affect the outcome of crosses line 0 or not
crossing line 0.

**a.** Generate 100 random `x` and `theta` values *remember* $\theta =
[0,~2\pi]$

**b.** Calculate the x locations of the 100 needle ends e.g. $x_{end} = x
\pm \cos\theta$ _since length is unit 1.

**c.** Use
[`np.logical_and`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.logical_and.html)
to find the number of needles that have minimum $x_{end~min}<0$ and
maximum $x_{end~max}>0$. The ratio
$\frac{x_{end~min}<0~and~x_{end~max}>0}{number~of~needles} =
\frac{2}{\pi}$ *for large values of $number~of~needles$*.

```{code-cell} ipython3
rng = np.random.default_rng()

N_needles = 100000
x = rng.uniform(0, 1, N_needles)
theta = rng.uniform(-np.pi/2, np.pi/2, N_needles) # used range [-pi/2, pi/2] so that x_end_max > x_end_min

x_end_max = x + np.cos(theta)
x_end_min = x - np.cos(theta)

cross_zero = np.logical_and(x_end_min<0, x_end_max>0)
ratio = sum(cross_zero) / N_needles

pi = 2/ratio
print(f'{pi = }')
```

**2.** Build a random walk data set with steps between $dx = dy =
-1/2~to~1/2~m$. If 100 particles take 10 steps, calculate the number of
particles that move further than 0.5 m.

*Bonus: Can you do the work without any `for`-loops? Change the size of
`dx` and `dy` to account for multiple particles.*

```{code-cell} ipython3
rng = np.random.default_rng()
N_particles = 100
N_steps = 10

dx = rng.random((N_particles, N_steps)) - 0.5
dy = rng.random((N_particles, N_steps)) - 0.5
x = np.sum(dx, 1)
y = np.sum(dy, 1)

dist = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
d = 0.5
print(f'Number of particles that move more than {d}m: {sum(dist>d)}')
```

**3.** 100 steel rods are going to be used to support a 1000 kg structure. The
rods will buckle when the load in any rod exceeds the [critical buckling
load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_critical_load)

$P_{cr}=\frac{\pi^3 Er^4}{16L^2}$

where E=200e9 Pa, r=0.01 m +/-0.001 m, and L is the
length of the rods supporting the structure. Create a Monte
Carlo model `montecarlo_buckle` that predicts
the mean and standard deviation of the buckling load for 100
samples with normally distributed dimensions r and L.

```python
mean_buckle_load,std_buckle_load=\
montecarlo_buckle(E,r_mean,r_std,L,N=100)
```

**a.** What is the mean_buckle_load and std_buckle_load for L=5 m?

**b.** What length, L, should the beams be so that only 2.5% will
reach the critical buckling load?

```{code-cell} ipython3
def montecarlo_buckle(E,r_mean,r_std,L,N=100):
    '''Generate N rods of length L with radii of r=r_mean+/-r_std
    then calculate the mean and std of the buckling loads in for the
    rod population holding a 1000-kg structure
    Arguments
    ---------
    E: Young's modulus [note: keep units consistent]
    r_mean: mean radius of the N rods holding the structure
    r_std: standard deviation of the N rods holding the structure
    L: length of the rods (or the height of the structure)
    N: number of rods holding the structure, default is N=100 rods
    Returns
    -------
    mean_buckle_load: mean buckling load of N rods under 1000*9.81/N-Newton load
    std_buckle_load: std dev buckling load of N rods under 1000*9.81/N-Newton load
    '''
    rng = np.random.default_rng()
    r = rng.uniform(r_mean-r_std, r_mean+r_std, N) 
    buckle_load = np.pi**3 * E * r**4 / (16 * L**2)
    
    load_in_beam = 1000*9.81/N
    pct_fails = sum(buckle_load < load_in_beam)/N * 100

    return buckle_load.mean(), buckle_load.std(), pct_fails

L = 5
bl_mean, bl_std, pct_fails = montecarlo_buckle(200e9, 0.01, 0.001, L)
print(f'Buckle Load for {L}m beams: {bl_mean:.2f} ± {bl_std:.2f} N')

dL = .001
while pct_fails < 2.5:
    L += dL
    *_, pct_fails = montecarlo_buckle(200e9, 0.01, 0.001, L)
print(f'Percent Fails for {L:.3f}m beams: {pct_fails} %')
```
